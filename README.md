# An-efficient-automatic-accident-detection-System-using-IoT
# About Project :-
Road accidents are a leading cause of death in India, largely as a result of the 
victims' delayed medical attention. Thus, when a traffic accident occurs, the 
alerting system would activate, sending the victim's family and friends a 
message with the time and location of the accident. As a result, the injured 
could receive immediate treatment. By this system, the essential parameters and 
sensor values get communicated to AWS services and accidents would be 
discovered using GPS system.
